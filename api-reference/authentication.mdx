---

You can authenticate with the Linkvite API by providing an API Key or an Access Token. You can manage your API Keys in the [developers dashboard](https://app.linkvite.io/developers).

- **API Keys**: Used to authenticate requests made to all public of the Linkvite API. They are long-lived and can be regenerated at any time.
- **Access Tokens**: They are used to authenticate requests made to the Linkvite API on behalf of a user. They are short-lived and can be refreshed using a refresh token.

<Note>
    All requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
